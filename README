A small, just for fun script to check whether or not you are in an instance
of GNU screen. Yes, you could just type "screen -list" or whatnot, but
this is a reference to the movie Inception. Leonardo DiCaprio spins a top to 
see if he is in a dream. If he is, it spins forever. If it falls, he knows he 
is awake. Inspired by realizing I was in a screen within a screen within 
a screen.
